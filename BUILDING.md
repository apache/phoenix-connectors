<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications. Visit the Apache Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>. This repo contains connectors for third party libraries to access data stored in Phoenix/HBase.

## Building Apache Phoenix Connectors

This repository will build jars for the different Phoenix connectors.
Phoenix 4 and Phoenix 5 versions use different Hadoop and HBase versions, and require separate versions of the connectors.
Phoenix 4 requires Hadoop 2.x and HBase 1.x, while Phoenix 5 requires Hadoop 3.x and HBase 2.x
The standard build process builds the connectors both for Phoenix 4 and Phoenix 5.

```
$ mvn package
```

### Building against specific Phoenix version
To build a release of Phoenix Connectors which packages a specific version of Phoenix, specify the `phoenix-four.version` or the `phoenix-five.version` system property to indicate a specific Phoenix version.

Phoenix Connectors will package the same version of Phoenix used for build/test. This version is controlled by the
`phoenix-four.version` and the `phoenix-five.version` system properties.

When specifying `phoenix-four.version` and the `phoenix-five.version`, also specify the HBase version to be used
by the corresponding `hbase-one.version` and `hbase-two.version` system properties.
Similarly you can overwrite the `hadoop-two.version` and the `hadoop-three.version` system properties if necessary.

```
$ mvn package -Dphoenix-five.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Running integration tests

`mvn package` will run the unit tests while building, but it will not run the integration test suite.

The IT suite is run when executing `mvn install` or `mvn verify`. The Phoenix version specified
with `phoenix-four.version` and the `phoenix-five.version` are used for running the integration tests.

```
$ mvn verify -Dphoenix-four.version=4.16.0-SNAPSHOT -Dhbase-one.version=1.5.0
```
```
$ mvn install -Dphoenix-five.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dhbase-one.version=2.1.9 -Dhadoop-three.version=3.0.3
```

### Skipping Phoenix 4/5 modules

You can specify `-Dskip-phoenix4` or `-Dskip-phoenix5` system property to skip building the connectors for Phoenix 4 or Phoenix 5 altogether. It is useful to reduce the feedback time while working on a change for a specific Phoenix version or when you don't actually need the connectors for both Phoenix 4 and 5.

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dskip-phoenix4
```
