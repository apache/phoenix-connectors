<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications. Visit the Apache Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>. This repo contains connectors for third party libraries to access data stored in Phoenix/HBase.

## Building Apache Phoenix Connectors

This repository will build jars for the different Phoenix connectors.

```
$ mvn package
```

### Building against specific Phoenix version
To build a release of Phoenix Connectors which packages a specific version of Phoenix, specify the `phoenix.version` system property to indicate a specific Phoenix version.


When specifying `phoenix.version`, also specify the HBase version to be used
by the corresponding `hbase-two.version` system property.
Similarly you can override the `hadoop-three.version` system properties if necessary.

```
$ mvn package -Dphoenix-five.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

### Running integration tests

`mvn package` will run the unit tests while building, but it will not run the integration test suite.

The IT suite is run when executing `mvn install` or `mvn verify`. The Phoenix version specified
with `phoenix.version` is used for running the integration tests.

```
$ mvn install -Dphoenix-five.version=5.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dhbase-one.version=2.1.9 -Dhadoop-three.version=3.0.3
```
